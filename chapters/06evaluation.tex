    Test setup...
    Test server is shared, so use less cores than available to minimize variation due to background tasks?

    \section{Performance}
    Basically the answer to RQ1: Is the backwards search efficient enough to perform analysis on real world apps?

    \section{Comparison to forwards analysis}
    Basically the answer to RQ2: Can we find a pre-analysis known parameter to decide which analysis is more efficient?
